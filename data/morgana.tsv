167	Noir's electrified! She can't move like this!
168	Crow's been shocked! He can't move that easily now!
169	Gah, you got shocked! You can't move as well now!
170	Joker's dizzy! His accuracy's going to be worse now!
171	Skull's dizzy! He's going to miss a lot more now!
172	I'm dizzy... Can't see straight...
173	Panther's dazed! Her attacks won't hit as often!
174	Fox is dizzy! He'll have trouble landing his attacks!
175	Queen is dizzy! It'll be a lot harder to land attacks now!
176	Noir, you're dizzy! Your accuracy's down, and you're more vulnerable!

192	Fox is scared! He might bolt!
193	Queen is really scared! She might run if it comes down to it!
194	Noir's shaking! If she's that scared, she might try to run!
195	Crow's scared... I hope he doesn't run!
196	Oh no! You're scared out of your mind!
197	Joker can't call his Persona! He's forgotten everything!
198	Skull's got amnesia!?
199	...Huh? Uh... What was I doing again?
200	Panther's forgotten how to summon her Persona!
201	Fox can't use his Persona! He's forgotten how!
202	Queen's forgotten how to call her Persona!
203	Noir's lost her memory! She can't use her Persona!
204	Crow's forgotten how to summon his Persona!
205	Wait... Did you forget how to summon your Persona!?
206	Joker's hungry!? He's losing his strength!
207	Skull's powered down. He's way too hungry! Is there a beef bowl anywhere!?
208	I'm out of energy... I need a snack...
209	Panther's starving! Her attack power is plummeting!
210	Fox is hungry! He's losing power!
211	Queen's too hungry! Her attack power is down!
212	Noir's out of energy! She needs food!

214	You've hit the wall! Eat some food and you won't feel weak!
215	Joker's asleep!? Not good... He's vulnerable!
216	Skull's fallen asleep! He can't defend himself!
217	Zzz... Finally, I'm... human...
218	Panther's fallen asleep! Hey, rise and shine!
219	Fox is asleep! If they go for him now, it'll hurt!
220	Queen, wake up! It'll be a problem if you get attacked now!
221	Noir's sleeping! This could get dangerous!
222	Crow's fallen asleep! He can't defend himself!
223	Hey, come on! Wake up!
224	Joker's losing his cool! He's getting too reckless!
225	Skull's enraged!? Hey, just calm down! Listen to me!
226	Rrraaaaah! I'm pissed, dammit!!
227	Panther's mad!? W-Wait, calm down!
228	Fox is going berserk! Hey, listen to us!
229	Queen's snapped! She's being too reckless!
230	Noir's lost it! Someone stop her before she gets herself hurt!
231	Crow's lost his temper! Hey, come to your senses!
232	Hey, don't lose your head!
233	Joker's in despair! We can't just leave him like this!
234	Skull's losing heart! We have to save him!
235	It's hopeless... I'm gonna be a cat for the rest of my life...
236	Panther's despondent! We can't just ignore her!
237	We have to help Fox! The despair is overwhelming him!
238	Queen's in despair! Come on, snap out of it!
239	Noir's depressed! Isn't there anything we can do!?
240	Crow looks miserable... We need to save him from this!
241	Hey! Don't give up now... Hang in there!
242	Joker's brainwashed! He can't tell who's who!
243	Skull's been brainwashed! We're the good guys, genius!
244	Meow? M-Meeeeyyoooow!?
245	Panther's brainwashed!? Wake up!
246	Fox is brainwashed! He can't tell friend from foe!
247	Queen's been brainwashed! No, we're teammates!
248	Noir's been brainwashed! She's helping the enemy!
249	Crow's brainwashed! He's going rogue!
250	You're brainwashed! Can't you tell who's on your side!?
251	Joker's been turned into a mouse!
252	Skull's a mouse! He's helpless!
253	*squeak squeak squeeeaaak*!
254	Panther's a mouse now! Oh, she doesn't stand  a chance like that!
255	Fox is just a mouse now! He can't do much like that!
256	Queen's a mouse! We have to help her!
257	Noir's been turned into a mouse! She's powerless!
258	Crow's a mouse! He's at the enemy's mercy!
259	You've been turned into a mouse! This isn't good!
260	All right, time for a counterattack!
261	Skull's back up! Let's give them some payback!
262	Time for my comeback with style and grace!
263	All right, Panther's back!
264	Fox! It's time to turn the tables!
265	Queen's back on the front lines! Time to return the favor!
266	Noir's back up! All right!
267	Crow's gotten up! It's time to fight back!
268	All right! Now's our chance!
269	The battle's turned in our favor! Let's attack!
270	Now's our chance!
271	We're on the defensive! Watch out!
272	The enemy's still got the advantage. Give it all you've got!
273	You can hit the enemy's weakness if you perform a Baton Pass here!
274	Performing a Baton Pass now might help you knock them down!
275	This is the perfect time for a Baton Pass!
276	Don't you think now's a good opportunity for a Baton Pass?
277	You can knock down more of them if you use a Baton Pass!
278	Yes! A clean hit!
279	Nice one! They're at your mercy!
280	Nice! Your gambit worked!
281	Great! Nice move!
282	Heh heh... All according to plan!

318	That's three less to worry about! Not bad!
319	Keep up the pace! That's two enemies down for Joker!
320	Good job, Skull! That's two we don't need to worry about!
321	Two birds with one stone! And I'm not done yet!
322	All right, Panther! That's two out of the way!
323	Fox defeated two foes! Don't stop now!
324	Queen, that was amazing! Two enemies defeated!
325	That's the spirit, Noir! Two foes defeated!
326	Excellent work, Crow! Two enemies defeated!
327	Nice one! Two enemies down!
328	Joker took one out! All right!
329	An enemy defeated! Skull, gimme more!

379	Good one, Noir!
380	Excellent, Crow!
381	Nice! The enemy's down!
382	Nice, Joker! Right in their weak spot!
383	Skull nailed their weak spot! Not bad at all!
384	I hit their weakness! It's all too easy!
385	Hit confirmed! You got their weakness, Panther!
386	That hit its weak point! Keep it going, Fox!
387	Queen hit their weakness! Nice!
388	Straight to their weak spot! Great job, Noir!
389	Weak point, locked on! Nice one, Crow!
390	That hit their weakness!
391	A smash hit! Joker, that was cool!
392	Not bad! Skull got in a solid hit!
393	Ahhh, that felt good!
394	Wow, Panther...! I'm in love all over again!

399	Now that's a hit!
400	You missed!? Come on, Joker!

402	I missed!? Really!?
403	Panther! Watch them carefully!
404	Fox, you gotta aim!
405	Queen! Get a hold of yourself!
406	Noir, aim carefully!
407	You gotta watch their movements, Crow!
408	What was that!? Focus!

435	Hold on just a bit more! There's gotta be a way out of this.
436	Now! Let's get out of here!
437	All right! I'll look for a way out!
438	Don't rush me! I'm looking for an opening!
439	Gah... It's just not happening! We can't escape!
440	Finish 'em!
441	OK, guys! Let's do it!
442	This'll end it!
443	Maybe you can hit their weak point?
444	This is our chance! You can hit their weakness!
445	Ooh, you can aim for their weak spot!
446	We can't hit the enemy's weak spot right now...
447	I don't think you have any skills that'll hit its weakness...
448	Looks like hitting its weak point isn't an option...
449	The enemy's terrified! I think now's the time for that move!
450	Gunshots should hit its weakness!
451	If you do a Baton Pass, you might be able to hit their weakness!
452	This move should work!
453	Guns should work fine!
454	It's weak to Physical attacks!
455	Physical attacks should work!
456	We've got some options, but we'd better find a weakness.
457	I don't know their weakness... Guess we gotta try everything!
458	We should check its affinity...

638	You can hit the enemy's weakness if you perform a Baton Pass here!
639	Performing a Baton Pass now might help you knock them down!
640	This is the perfect time for a Baton Pass!
641	Don't you think now's a good opportunity for a Baton Pass?
642	You can knock down more of them if you use a Baton Pass!
643	Watch out! They're going to attack!
644	The Shadow is about to attack! Heal yourself, quickly!
645	Watch your health! The enemy is ready to strike!
646	They're about to attack! Make sure you're ready for it!
647	Recover quickly, before the enemy starts their attack!
648	An enemy's on fire! Hit it with a Wind attack for major damage!
649	There's a frozen enemy! A meaty Physical attack should break them apart!
650	The enemy is electrocuted! Melee attacks should work, but don't get electrocuted yourself!
651	An enemy's asleep! Now's our chance to strike!
652	There's a dizzy enemy! Follow up and knock them down!
653	Whoa, it's strong! Don't get careless, you guys!
654	Physical attacks are its weakness. Let's try to use this to our advantage.
655	It might be strong, but it's weak to Gun attacks. Just don't run out of ammo!
656	This is one tough enemy... It's weak to Fire though, so let's go for that!
657	It's really strong! Let's go after its Ice weakness!
658	This one's powerful, but it's weak against Wind attacks!
659	The enemy's tough, but if we can hit it with Electricity...
660	This Shadow is scary! Let's end this quickly with a Bless attack!
661	It's a powerful enemy, but it should be weak to Curse attacks!
662	It may be tougher than normal, but it's weak to Nuclear attacks. If we can hit it with those...
663	This enemy is susceptible to Psychokinesis, but watch out... it's still strong!
664	Not only is it formidable, but Physical attacks won't work! We can't force our way through!
665	Guns won't work against this strong enemy! Be careful!
666	It's a powerful foe... Fire's no good. Use something else!
667	Strong and resistant to Ice, huh?
668	We can't use Wind on this one! Keep your guard up--it's strong!
669	That's a tough one! Electricity won't be very effective, got that?
670	Our opponent is really strong. Bless attacks won't work on it!
671	Watch out, Curse skills are no good on this one!
672	It's not only tough, but immune to Nuclear attacks too...! Hold on!
673	It's way stronger than us! On top of that, Psychokinesis won't work!
674	We're about even... but don't let your guard down, OK?
675	It's weak to Physical attacks! This should be easy!
676	It can't handle Gun attacks! Just watch your ammo!
677	This opponent is our equal! Oh, and it's weak to Fire!
678	Ice is its weakness. Let's freeze it solid.
679	Wind attacks are the best route! You can handle this if you just stay calm!
680	There's not much difference between our strength levels! Oh, but it's weak to Electricity!
681	It's weak to Bless attacks! Do you have any?
682	Curse should work, huh? Maybe we can get an instant kill...
683	It's susceptible to Nuclear attacks. Let's aim for that!
684	Looks like this one is weak to Psychokinesis moves.
685	Physical attacks are no good. Don't accidentally use one!
686	Guns don't seem to work. Try something else.
687	Fire is no good!
688	So the enemy is resistant to Ice... Be careful.
689	Don't use Wind skills. You'll need to try something else!
690	Electric attacks won't do anything. Watch which moves you choose!
691	Bless attacks are ineffective. You'll have to find another route.
692	Watch out, Curse skills are a no-go!
693	So Nuclear attacks are worthless against this one... We'll have to keep that in mind.
694	It blocks Psychokinesis!? What a troublesome enemy...
695	This one is weaker than us. We should win easy as long as we don't underestimate it!
696	So it's weak, plus it can't handle Physical attacks? Come on, let's rush it!
697	Gun shots will tear through it like paper! Let's do this!
698	We have the advantage here! Hit it with Fire!
699	Oh, it's weak against Ice. This should be easy... We're way stronger than this one!
700	The opponent is nothing compared to us! Let's clean up with some Wind attacks!
701	Electricity is super effective! This shouldn't take long!
702	Bless attacks are a great strategy against this one. Don't mess around with a weak enemy!
703	Curse attacks work well! This enemy is weak... Get it!
704	A good Nuclear attack should put an end to this quickly!
705	It's weak to Psychokinesis. Well, this shouldn't be a very tough battle to win.
706	It might be weak, but Physical attacks still won't work...
707	This one's particularly puny, but Gun attacks won't work on it. You need to try something else!
708	Fire attacks are no good... What a brazen enemy.
709	Ice skills won't work. It might be weak, but don't let your guard down.
710	It's just a weakling, but Wind attacks still won't be any good.
711	The enemy's not strong, but it can handle Electricity moves. Stay on your guard.
712	Bless skills are a no-go! Try a different type of move!
713	We can't use Curse skills on it! Don't let your guard down.
714	Nuclear attacks won't work...? It seems pretty weak...
715	No Psychokinesis skills! Give something else a shot!
716	There's an enemy on high alert! Watch out!
717	The security level's high... There's an enemy that's buffed up!
718	That dark enemy's all  powered up! Be careful!
719	One of them's strong! Watch out for the darker enemy!
720	One enemy's a major threat! Stay alert while you fight it!
721	The enemy's got our number! The situation's grim!
722	Hey, now's not the time to be fighting! They're on high alert!
723	The security level's dangerously high! Don't attack head-on!
724	They're under heavy guard now! It's too dangerous to bother with them!
725	They're all out for blood! It won't end well if you choose to fight!
726	There's an enemy gunning for you! Watch the dark Shadow!
727	That darker Shadow is stronger than usual!
728	There's a high-powered enemy! If you're taking it on, stay focused!
729	They're on high alert! They sent out a really tough enemy!
730	There's an enemy keeping a close eye on us!
731	You already passed the baton to them!
732	They can't move right now. Try someone else!
733	I can't move... You want someone else...
734	That won't work right now!
735	Words aren't getting through!
736	Don't let your guard down!
737	Stay focused!
738	Whoa! Incredible, Joker!
739	Not bad! Excellent marksmanship!
740	
741	
742	
743	
744	All right! Pass the baton and follow up!
745	It's not over yet!
746	Pass it on to the second person!
747	Another Baton Pass!
748	And that's everyone! Nice strategy, team!
749	Everyone's done their job. Let's keep pushing!
750	You powered up from the Baton Pass!
751	All right! The Baton Pass made you stronger!
752	The second operative's up next! Your power keeps rising!
753	Keep passing that baton! You're getting stronger!
754	Everyone's gotten a chance now! Let's see all that power!
755	The baton's gone to everyone! Your power's as high as it'll go!
756	Yes! Marvelous!
757	Ooh, very nice! We got an item!
758	I guess those social skills are really paying off!
759	So diplomatic! You got another item!
760	It's trying to run! Watch out!
761	We can't let it escape now! Take it out!
762	It got away... Security's going to be tight from now on...
763	That's bad! It's going to contact its allies now!
764	We're breaking through their  ranks! Just follow Joker!

782	Why you...!
783	Shoot...
784	Shoot...!
785	A powerful enemy! It's not wise to fight head-on!
786	That one's strong... I don't advise fighting it!
