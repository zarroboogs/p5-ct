446	Do you have something to hit their weakness...? Welp, guess not!
447	You don't have any skills that'll hit its weak spot.
448	Doesn't look like you can go for its weakness...
449	There's an enemy that's scared! Now might be the perfect time...
450	Guns! You gotta use your guns!
451	Pass the baton and knock 'em down!
452	This should do it!
453	Gunshots are really good here!
454	You can hit its weakness with Physical attacks!
455	Physical attacks should do the trick!
456	You've got good moves, but maybe we should check for weaknesses first!
457	I dunno its weak point... It's trial-and-error time!
458	If I knew their affinity...! Just look for their weakness!
459	Hey, that one's got some treasure!
460	That enemy's got some loot of its own! Don't let it get away!
461	Hey, a rare drop!
462	Good work, everyone!
463	Just like I thought!
464	OK! Let's move on!
465	We got 'em, but we don't want to waste too much time.
466	All enemies defeated! You're still good to go, right?
467	Phew, that's a relief. Let's stay out of combat!

569	It's powerful, but weak to gunfire! You can handle this!
570	Fire is its weak point! It's powerful; hang in there!
571	This guy's weak to Ice! It's tough, but not unbeatable!

575	It's strong, but Curse attacks should get through! You can do it!
576	Nukes are its weakness! It's strong, but you can take it!
577	Weak to... Psychokinesis! It's tough, but it's beatable!

579	No guns here! This one's gonna be tough!
580	It's a tough one! Don't use Fire attacks!
581	Don't use any Ice skills! Be careful here!

585	Curse moves won't work, so be careful! It's a major threat!
586	It's strong, and Nuclear skills won't work. Keep your eyes open!
587	This one's powerful... And Psychokinetic stuff is useless!
588	All right, you can do it! This fight is ours!
589	It's weak to Physical hits! Knock 'em out!
590	Ooh, it's weak to gunfire! Ready... Aim...!
591	Weak to Fire! You can beat this guy!
592	Its weak point is Ice! Should be no problem!
593	Wind skills are effective! You can beat 'em!
594	Electricity should stop it! Go get 'em!
595	This guy's nothing special. It's weak to Bless attacks!
596	Curse skills oughta do it! Show 'em who's boss!
597	This one's weak to Nuclear!
598	Psychokinesis will mess this guy up!

607	Nukes won't work on this enemy!
608	Psychokinesis won't hurt this Shadow!
609	This guy's a joke! You could do this in your sleep!
610	Ooh, this one's easy. Just hit 'em with Physical strikes!
611	It can't take gunshots! Fill 'em with lead!
612	It's weak against Fire! Toasty!
613	It's weak to Ice! Turn 'em into a popsicle!
614	Wind works here! Let's clean 'em up!
615	Electricity's what you want. Fry their circuits.
616	Bless skills should work. Evil, begone!
617	Curses should help! Give 'em a one-way ticket to hell!
618	It can't take nuclear damage! Let's finish this off!
619	Psychokinesis works. Show 'em whatcha got.
620	It's a weakling, but Physical attacks won't work!
621	Guns won't work! But it's a total loser!
622	Fire won't help here... Ugh, but it's so pathetic!
623	Ice won't work? Wow, but it looks really weak.
624	Don't use Wind attacks! Otherwise, you're good!
625	This guy sucks. Oh, but don't use anything Electric.
626	Bless stuff won't work. Try something else!
627	Don't use Curse skills...! But really, it's totally weak.
628	Nuclear stuff won't work. Just use something else.

759	You got extra? You're pretty good with words.
760	That guy's trying to run! Watch out!
761	It'll be bad if we let it escape! Move quickly!
762	Oh, it got away... Security's gonna be tight now...
763	Not good! It's going to put everyone on alert!
764	It's a surge of lust! The fantasies are blocking everything out!
765	Oh no! The lust effect might keep you from moving!
766	Wrath!? No! You gotta  listen to me!
767	It's a surge of wrath!  You hafta try to calm down!
768	It's a surge of envy! It's trying to make you fight each other...
769	You're filled with envy!? Hey! Don't go against each other!
770	A surge of gluttony? Persona summoning might  take more effort...
771	Gluttony! Watch out when  you use your Personas! 
772	If you attack now, you'll be countered! Be careful!
773	Pride...! Don't attack, or you'll get countered instantly!
774	Hey! You need to  focus on the battle!
775	Hey! Now's not the time to get distracted!
776	Hey! Calm down! We're on your side!
777	Hey! We can't afford to fight amongst ourselves!
